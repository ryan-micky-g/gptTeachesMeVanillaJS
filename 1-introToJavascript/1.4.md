## 1.4 Variables in JavaScript

Variables are used to store data in JavaScript. In this section, we'll cover how to declare variables and understand the differences between the `var`, `let`, and `const` keywords, as well as the concepts of variable scope and hoisting.

### Declaring Variables

Variables in JavaScript are declared using the `var`, `let`, or `const` keywords. The `var` keyword has been traditionally used to declare variables, but it is recommended to use `let` or `const` instead due to their improved scoping and hoisting behavior.

### The `var`, `let`, and `const` keywords

The `var` keyword has function scope, meaning that a variable declared with `var` is accessible within the entire function where it is declared, as well as any nested functions.

The `let` keyword has block scope, meaning that a variable declared with `let` is only accessible within the block of code where it is declared, and any nested blocks.

The `const` keyword is used to declare constant variables, which cannot be reassigned after declaration. `const` has block scope like `let`.

Example:

    if (true) {
    let x = 10;
    var y = 20;
    }
    console.log(x); // ReferenceError: x is not defined
    console.log(y); // Output: 20

### Variable Scope

Variable scope refers to the accessibility of variables within a program. Variables declared with `var` have function scope, while variables declared with `let` or `const` have block scope.

### Hoisting

Hoisting is a behavior in JavaScript where variables declared with `var` are moved to the top of their scope, regardless of where they are declared within the code. This means that a variable declared with `var` can be used before it is declared within its scope.

Example:

    console.log(x); // Output: undefined
    var x = 10;


Variables declared with `let` or `const` are not hoisted, and cannot be used before they are declared within their scope.
