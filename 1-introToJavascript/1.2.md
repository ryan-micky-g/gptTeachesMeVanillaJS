## 1.2 Setting up the development environment

Before you can start writing and executing JavaScript code, you need to set up your development environment. This includes installing Node.js and a code editor.

### Installing Node.js

Node.js is a JavaScript runtime environment that allows you to run JavaScript code on the server-side. It is widely used for building back-end web applications and is an essential tool for any JavaScript developer. To install Node.js, visit the official website at https://nodejs.org and download the latest version for your operating system.

### Setting up a code editor

A code editor is a text editor that is specifically designed for writing code. There are many code editors available, both free and paid, including Visual Studio Code, Sublime Text, and Atom. Choose the one that best suits your needs and preferences.

Once you have installed Node.js and set up a code editor, you can start creating your first JavaScript file. To do this, simply create a new file with a .js extension and start writing your code. To run the file, open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the folder where your file is located. Then, type `node filename.js` to run the file and see the output.
