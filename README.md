# gptTeachesMeVanillaJS

I want to learn Javascript, and I am having ChatGPT plus teach me. Will be interesting to see how this goes, and how often i need to look elsewhere to fix things haha. I intend to use nodeJS to learn it for back-end operations, although I may switch to a web context in short order. 

# Me Discussing my plan with ChatGPT!

I am going to post to github a chatgpt course (potentially not perfect) and my experience learning javascript in this manner. i will also document when i have to resort to google or other non-ai generated sources to correct incorrect information. this will be something people can see so they see the strengths AND weaknesses of AI driven learning. do you understand my plan?

Response:

	Yes, I understand your plan. Creating a course that documents your experience learning JavaScript using AI-generated resources, and recording when you have to resort to non-AI sources for correction, is a unique and interesting approach. It can be a valuable resource for others who are considering using AI-generated resources for learning programming or other technical subjects.
	It's important to note that AI-generated resources, including my responses, should be used as a starting point for learning, rather than a comprehensive guide. AI models like me are trained on a large amount of text data, but there may be errors or inaccuracies in the information provided. By documenting your experience and highlighting the strengths and weaknesses of AI-generated resources, you can help others make informed decisions about how they approach their own learning.
